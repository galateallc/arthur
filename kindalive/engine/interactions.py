"""Cross-chemical interaction rules.

These run after decay each sub-step. They model how chemicals affect
each other (cortisol erodes serotonin, GABA dampens adrenaline, etc.).

**Equilibrium principle.** Every interaction term is written so that it
*vanishes when the relevant chemical is at its baseline*. That makes the
all-baseline resting state a true fixed point: at rest nothing drifts.
Interactions are couplings between *perturbations*, not constant pushes
toward 0 or 1.

This matters because the chemicals have very different decay timescales
(adrenaline ~3 min, cortisol ~1 h, serotonin ~4 h). An older version
used constant per-second pushes toward zero (e.g. ``cortisol -= oxytocin
* 0.08``); those overwhelmed the slow decay-toward-baseline and *pinned*
chemicals at their extremes — cortisol and GABA collapsed to 0, which in
turn removed adrenaline's damping and let testosterone ratchet adrenaline
to 1.0. Gating each rule on the deviation-from-baseline removes that
failure mode while preserving the intended directional effects.

Important: clamping to [0, 1] happens AFTER all rules run in a sub-step,
not between individual rules.
